# web2021
Web development in 2021 summer.
I used two servers. 
This is server 1: handle user login, user interface, display products, account manager, 
my terrapin storage, display blockchain-ish public transaction records, user exchange, 
email services. 

Plan in future: implement delete action on my terrapin storage, ;;; 

#Server2: store user posted product (item/skills) info, assist display products. 
find server2 in here: https://github.com/jerryo0/server2.git

Plan in future (within 1 to 2 months): implement delete action on user posts.
